# DESCRIPTION:

*Project Description – Weather Dashboard Web Application*
  
  The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic and responsive web application that provides users with real-time weather information for any city in the world. This project integrates front-end web development technologies 
 and API services to create a modern and interactive user experience. The core objective of this application is to fetch and display current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather 
 conditions, using OpenWeatherMap's public REST API. It is an excellent example of practical API integration in a web project.
# Project Structure:

  weather-dashboard/
 
  ├── index.html

  ├── style.css
  
  └── script.js

# Technologies and Tools Used:



 # 1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
 
   HTML is used to define the structure and content of the webpage. It includes form fields for user input, alert messages, weather result sections, and organized Bootstrap-based components like cards and 
   buttons. HTML serves as the backbone of the application’s interface.

# 2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

   CSS is employed to style the application and ensure visual appeal. Custom styles are written to control layout, colors, typography, hover effects, background gradients, and transparent cards. Bootstrap 5 
   classes are also used to speed up UI development, making the design mobile-responsive and consistent across devices.

# 3.JavaScript:

   JavaScript is used as the scripting language to make the application interactive. It handles:

   ->Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the fetch() method.

   ->Parsing and displaying JSON responses dynamically.

   ->Adding event listeners (e.g., button clicks and Enter key submission).

   ->Updating DOM elements in real-time based on API responses.

   ->Displaying loading indicators and error messages conditionally.

   ->Changing the background image dynamically based on city input or a static gradient.


# 4.OpenWeatherMap API:

   This RESTful API provides real-time weather data in JSON format. By sending a city name and API key in a URL query, the application receives weather information including:

->City name and country.

->Temperature and "feels like" temperature.

->Weather condition and icon.

->Humidity and wind speed.

# 5.Bootstrap 5:

   Bootstrap is a widely used CSS framework that simplifies responsive and mobile-first design. In this application, it provides:

 ->Grid system for layout

 ->Styled components (cards, buttons, alerts, etc.)

 ->Utility classes for padding, margin, colors, and alignment Bootstrap drastically reduces the amount of custom CSS needed and ensures compatibility with different screen sizes.


# 6.Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

   VS Code is used as the development environment for writing, editing, and managing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The "Live Server" extension allows developers to view changes instantly in the browser during development.

# 7.Web Browser:

   Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) is used to run and test the application. It displays the real-time weather UI and handles dynamic content via JavaScript.

# KEY FEATURES :

  ->Real-time weather data using an API.

  ->Dynamic background customization using a city-based theme or static gradient.

  ->Responsive and mobile-friendly UI using Bootstrap.

  ->Error handling and loading indicators for better UX.

  ->Clean and transparent card layout with hover animations.

# Educational Value:

   This project demonstrates practical skills in client-side web development, API integration, asynchronous programming, and responsive design. It is ideal for students or developers learning to build 
   interactive web applications and handle third-party API data.
